        <section>
            <p>The oldest tomb of the Tzadikim (Righteous people) within the enclosure, at the far left, is that of
                Chief Rabbi Solomon Abudarham. He succeeded Rabbi Yehuda ben Yitshak Halevi as Gibraltar's Chief Rabbi.
                Rabbi Abudarham inaugurated the Flemish Synagogue (La Esnoga Flamenga) on Line Wall Road at the turn of
                the 19th century, laying the stone which still bears his name. He also established a school of religious
                study (Yeshiva) on Parliament Lane which today is the Abudarham Synagogue (La Esnoga Abudarham).</p>

            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Rabbi Solomon Abudarham was born into a distinguished rabbinical family. He is the son of Rabbi Abraham
                Abudarham, who was also a prominent rabbi. His family is believed to have originated from Spain, and
                like many other Sephardic Jews, they settled in Gibraltar following the expulsion from Spain in 1492.
            </p>
            <p>Solomon Abudarham succeeded Rabbi Yehudah Halevi as Chief Rabbi and served the Jewish community of
                Gibraltar during the 18th and early 19th centuries. His tenure as Chief Rabbi was marked by his efforts
                to maintain Jewish education and preserve the traditions of the community.</p>
