This project is dedicated to documenting the Tzadikim (righteous people) buried in the Jewish cemeteries of Gibraltar, including Jews' Gate and North Front cemeteries. It provides a simple, responsive website showcasing information about these Tzadikim, their graves, and their biographies. The website includes pages for notable rabbis such as Rabbi Solomon Abudarham, Rabbi Raphael Moshe Hassan, and Rabbi Yeshaya Anahory.
